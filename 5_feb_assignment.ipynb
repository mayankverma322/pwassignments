    "# Q1. Explain Class and Object with respect to Object-Oriented Programming. Give a suitable example.\n",
    "# A class is a blueprint or a template that defines the attributes and behaviors of objects. An object is an instance of a class, which represents a real-world entity.\n",
    "# Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "class Car:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, brand, model):\n",
    "        self.brand = brand\n",
    "        self.model = model\n",

    "# Q2. Name the four pillars of OOPs.\n",
    "# The four pillars of Object-Oriented Programming are:\n",
    "# 1. Encapsulation: Encapsulating data and methods into a single unit (class) to hide complexity and protect data.\n",
    "# 2. Inheritance: Creating new classes (derived classes) from existing classes (base classes) to reuse code and extend functionality.\n",
    "# 3. Polymorphism: The ability of objects of different classes to respond to the same method in different ways.\n",
    "# 4. Abstraction: Simplifying complex reality by representing essential features without including unnecessary details.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Q3. Explain why the __init__() function is used. Give a suitable example.\n",
    "# The __init__() function is used as a constructor in Python classes. It is automatically called when an object is created from the class and allows us to initialize the object's attributes.\n",
    "# Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "class Person:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, name, age):\n",
    "        self.name = name\n",
    "        self.age = age\n",
    "\n",

    "# Q4. Why self is used in OOPs?\n",
    "# 'self' is used in object-oriented programming as a reference to the instance of the class. It represents the current object, allowing access to its attributes and methods within the class.\n",
    "# It is the first parameter in class methods and is used to differentiate between instance variables and local variables.\n",
    "# Without 'self', we wouldn't be able to access or modify object-specific attributes and methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Q5. What is inheritance? Give an example for each type of inheritance.\n",
    "# Inheritance is a mechanism in object-oriented programming that allows a class (derived class or subclass) to inherit the properties and methods of another class (base class or superclass).\n",
    "# It promotes code reusability and helps create a hierarchy of classes.\n",

    "# Types of inheritance:\n",
    "# 1. Single Inheritance:\n",
    "#    - A derived class inherits from a single base class.\n",
